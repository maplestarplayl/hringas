//! Pure Rust `io_uring` bindings that do not rely on libc, or the rust standard
//! library. The api is designed to be simple and straight-forward.
//!
//! Start with [`IoUring`] - this is the primary entry point.
//!
//! This is a systems programming library at the same level of abstraction as
//! `liburing`. while `unsafe` methods are kept  to a minimum,  submitting
//! things to the linux kernel to be modified asynchronously is inherently
//! outside rust's concept of "safety".
//!
//! It is based on the [iouring implementation in the zig standard library](https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/src/branch/0.15.x/lib/std/os/linux/iouring.zig),
//! though the design is beginning to diverge. The only dependency in rustix,
//! which is roughly the equivalent of zig's `std.os`.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
#![doc = include_str!("../examples/readme.rs")]
//! ```
//!
//! Or, in `no_std`:
//! ```no_run
#![doc = include_str!("../examples/readme_no_std.rs")]
//! ```
